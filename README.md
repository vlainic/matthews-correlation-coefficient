# matthews-correlation-coefficient
MCC function for ML

Here I would like to share my implementation of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for various situations.

## Intro on MCC

I encountered MCC while search for the ["best multi-class classification metric"](https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/multiclass-metric.html).

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient#Multiclass_case) has very nice explanation of MCC, while at [stats.stackexchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/187768/matthews-correlation-coefficient-with-multi-class) you can find a very interesting discussion on the topic. Multi-class MCC is often called "R_K statistics" so I found [the whole page](http://rk.kvl.dk/introduction/index.html) devoted to it.

The most useful for computation was Eq.(8) from the original article by [Gorodkin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476927104000799?via%3Dihub):
